          I. Additional Content for New Grassroots Lobbyists or <br />
          New Lobbyists for Client Organizations to know when Lobbying in Albany
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A. A lobbyist must be able to compromise and be aware that the
            legislators might not give everything they ask for in a piece of
            legislation. This skill in lobbying involves client expectation
            management (if a lobbyist is lobbying on behalf of a specific
            client). The lobbyist must make the client aware that they may not
            receive everything they expected in a particular piece of
            legislation since compromises between lobbyists and different
            political factions alter legislation. Additionally, amendments to
            bills are made by legislators which can change what the client of
            the lobbyist wanted.
          </li>
          <li>
            B. Credibility and relationship building is critical in lobbying
            (this relates to the ethical obligations that lobbyists must
            follow). Lobbyists should make lawmakers aware of both the positive
            and negative sides to their issue or piece of legislation they are
            supporting (this is part of building a relationship with
            legislators). They need to make lawmakers aware of the negative side
            of their issue because the lawmaker has to weigh the positive and
            negative sides to an issue. Furthermore, if a lobbyist is not
            forthcoming with legislators and does not share the negative parts
            to their proposed law, the lobbyist will lose credibility with
            legislators on future issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            C. Coalition building is also important for lobbyists since it
            allows separate associations to combine their efforts in passing
            legislation that relates to their respective organizations.
            Legislators will be more willing to consider legislation if a wide
            variety of organizations back the legislation. Coalition building
            also allows different organizations to collaborate on issues and
            address these issues in a holistic manner.

            D. Lobbying laws for people lobbying in New York City:
            <ul>
              <li>1. Source: Office of the City Clerk, City of New York</li>
              <li>
                2. Lobbying in the City of New York (City) is governed by the
                New York City Administrative Code, Sections 3-211-223 (Lobbying
                Law) and Title 51 of the Rules of the City of New York Sections
                1-01-08 (Rules).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            E. Filing fees are due when filing a Statement of Registration ($150
            for the first Client registered and $50 for each additional Client
            registered). Fees can be paid by check, credit card (in person
            only), or money order payable to the City Clerk.

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section__heading">
          II. A Lobbyist or Client may request an extension to file a required
          report if:
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A. The Lobbyist or Client can show good cause;</li>

          <li>B. The request is made in writing (email acceptible); and</li>

          <li>C. The request is received prior to the filing deadline.</li>
          <li>
            D. When a Lobbyist reasonably anticipates that in the coming year it
            will earn, receive, or expend over $5,000 in compensation and
            expenses combined, for lobbying in New York City, the Lobbyist is
            required to file a Statement of Registration.
          </li>
          <li>
            E. The $5,000 threshold applies cumulatively to compensation a
            Lobbyist receives from all its Clients; it is not a threshold that
            must be reached for each individual Client. Once the threshold is
            exceeded, the Lobbyist must file a Statement of Registration for
            each Client.
          </li>
          <li>
            F. If the lobbyist is an architect or engineer, or an architecture
            or engineering firm, the threshold is $10,000.
          </li>
          <li>
            G. A Lobbyist who knows or reasonably anticipates by December 15 of
            the present year that it needs to file a Statement of Registration
            for the upcoming year, must file the Statement of Registration by
            the following January .
          </li>
          <li>
            H. In all other cases a Lobbyist must file within 15 days of being
            retained, but no later than 10 days from actually incurring or
            receiving reportable compensation and expenses
          </li>
          <li>
            I. A Statement of Registration must be filed for each Client each
            calendar year.
